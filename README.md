# IT Governance & Operational Guidelines
#### City of Asheville, NC

This site provides documentation of principles and procedures for key IT-managed functions, including our open data program and our software development processes.

## Open Data Program

On October 13, 2015 the Asheville City Council adopted a [resolution](http://coablog.ashevillenc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Resolution-No.-15-189.pdf) “directing the City Manager to establish an open data policy for the City of Asheville for sustaining public data availability using open data standards.” That resolution outlines high-level requirements for the City of Asheville's open data efforts. This effort allows us to go beyond minimal compliance with  [NC open records laws (NC General Statute Chapter 132)](https://www.ncga.state.nc.us/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bychapter/chapter_132.html) to enhance the value of City data for the community.
